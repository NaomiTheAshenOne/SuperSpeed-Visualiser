## Info
This app allows you to display the different areas your stick needs to be for M and D speed.

In theory this should be operating system and controller agnostic, fingers crossed XD

## Install Guide
NOTE: The app will close itself if it cannot detect a controller (it will tell you a gamepad cannot be found in the terminal the app was ran with)

Download python, install pygame and then just run the Visualiser.py file

## Windows 10/11 Install Guide
* Open file explorer and navigate to the folder that you have the Visualiser.py stored.

* Then right click and press "open in terminal"

* Type "Python", press enter and install it with the microsoft store pop up (DO THIS EVEN IF YOU'VE ALREADY INSTALLED USING PYTHON WITH THE SETUP EXE)

* After it installs type "pip install pygame"

* Then just enter "python3 .\Visualiser.py" in a cmd prompt in the folder the Visualiser.py is stored.
